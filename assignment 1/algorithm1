step 1:
=======
first select random n reads from given reads database and store it in a list.

step 2:
======
assemble the reads and create Genome:
reads is a list of selected reads.

    current_Index = 0
    genome = reads[0]
    firstRead = reads[current_Index]
    while True:
        current_Read = reads[current_Index]
        if 1 == len(reads):
            break
        del reads[current_Index]
        current_Index, overlap = self.findLongestOverlap(current_Read + '$', reads)
        genome += reads[current_Index][overlap:]
    current_Index, overlap = self.findLongestOverlap(reads[0] + '$', [firstRead])
    if overlap > 0:
        return genome[:-overlap]
    else:
        return genome
